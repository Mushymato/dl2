a plain start attack, no matter how fast you release the touch, there still be about 0.15s from touch to attack start

marker is not affected by attack speed

0.22 might be good selection for lantency of human operate FS
0.167: the fastest cancel timing from x1 to fs (but impossible for human)
0.42: hold time to trigger fs marker
